# TODO

## First
* Alias from discord
* Connect list with people in the server, so people in the server is automatically in the list or atleast that people can be voted on from beeing in the server
* Alias_id should return discord nickname if there is no alias

### Bettingsystem for who will be the next one to downvote you
This idea will build up a coin system that will give money depending on what kind of bets you do. Different bets could be:
* Next person who will vote you up/down
* The closest person to write at a given time
* Coin tossing
* etc
Depending on the bet the person could be able to win money, with different amount depending on how hard of a bet it is. The coins will later be usable for buing different roles and stuff like that.

### Adding cite function
This could be done with just saving cite in the json and then printing random quotes every week or something. Or it could be done with the implementation said + the option to vote from 1-10 how good the quote is and then having a tier-list for the highest score. One way to implement it would be with reacting on the quote with a number 1-10 or something similar.

## Some more ideas
* (Adding birthday function?)
* (Adding urlzoom?)
* Counting messages sent on the server
* Welcome new people
* Make ping work


## Much later
* Music bot
